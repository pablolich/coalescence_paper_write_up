We are submitting a manuscript titled {\it The role of competition vs cooperation in microbial community coalescence}, for consideration an article in {\it PLOS Computational Biology}. 

Microbial communities are widespread throughout our planet \cite{Fierer2006}, from the the human gut to the deep ocean, and play a critical role in natural processes ranging from animal development and host health \cite{Huttenhower2012, McFall-Ngai2013} to biogeochemical cycles \cite{Falkowski2008}. These communities are very complex, typically harbouring hundreds of species \cite{Gilbert2014}, making them hard to characterize. Recently, DNA sequencing has allowed a high-resolution mapping of these communities, opening a niche for theoreticians and experimentalists to collaboratively decipher their complexity and assembly \cite{Costello2012,Friedman2017,Goldford2018,Goyal2018,Marsland2019,Vila2019,Estrela2020,Coyte2021,Fant2021}.

Unlike in the macroscopic world, entire, distinct microbial communities are often displaced over space and come into contact with each other due to physical (e.g., dispersal by wind or water) and biological (e.g., animal-animal interactions or leaves falling to the ground) factors \cite{Kort2014, Evans2020,Luo2020, Vass2021}. The process by which two or more communities that were previously separated join and reassemble into a new community has been termed community coalescence \cite{Rillig2015}. Despite the frequency of microbial community coalescence, the outcome of such events in terms of community structure and function remains poorly understood \cite{Rillig2016b}.

Here, we focus on the gap in our understanding of the relative importance of competition and cooperation in community coalescence, which is is largely missing. We use a consumer resource model that includes cross-feeding to assemble complex, cohesive microbial communities spanning a broad range in the competition-cooperation spectrum. Using a novel metric, we then quantify community-level competition and cooperation in the assembled communities, as well as their ``cohesiveness''. Using this metric, we then determine the relative importance of the two types of interactions on success in pairwise coalescence events.

Encounters between microbial communities  are becoming increasingly frequent \cite{Seebens2017}, and mixing of whole microbial communities is gaining popularity for bio-engineering \cite{Rillig2016}, soil restoration \cite{Calderon2017}, faecal microbiota transplantation \cite{Wang2019, Wilson2019}, and the use of probiotics \cite{Lindemann2016}. We present a framework which relates the nature of species interaction in microbial communities to the outcome of community coalescence events. Although more work is required to bridge the gap between theory and empirical observations, this study constitutes a key step in that direction, and is likely to attract interest from a broad audience.
