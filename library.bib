abstract = {Empirical evidences show that ecosystems with high biodiversity can persist in time even in the presence of few types of resources and are more stable than low biodiverse communities. This evidence is contrasted by the conventional mathematical modeling, which predicts that the presence of many species and/or cooperative interactions are detrimental for ecological stability and persistence. Here we propose a modelling framework for population dynamics, which also include indirect cooperative interactions mediated by other species (e.g. habitat modification). We show that in the large system size limit, any number of species can coexist and stability increases as the number of species grows, if mediated cooperation is present, even in presence of exploitative or harmful interactions (e.g. antibiotics). Our theoretical approach thus shows that appropriate models of mediated cooperation naturally lead to a solution of the long-standing question about complexity-stability paradox and on how highly biodiverse communities can coexist.},

abstract = {The genus Artemisia consists of about 500 species, occurring throughout the world. Some very important drug leads have been discovered from this genus, notably artemisinin, the well known anti-malarial drug isolated from the Chinese herb Artemisia annua. The genus is also known for its aromatic nature and hence research has been focussed on the chemical compositions of the volatile secondary metabolites obtained from various Artemisia species. In the southern African region, A. afra is one of the most popular and commonly used herbal medicines. It is used to treat various ailments ranging from coughs and colds to malaria and diabetes. Although it is one of the most popular local herbal medicines, only limited scientific research, mainly focussing on the volatile secondary metabolites content, has been conducted on this species. The aim of this review was therefore to collect all available scientific literature published on A. afra and combine it into this paper. In this review, a general overview will be given on the morphology, taxonomy and geographical distribution of A. afra. The major focus will however be on the secondary metabolites, mainly the volatile secondary metabolites, which have been identified from this species. In addition all of the reported biological activities of the extracts derived from this species have been included as well as the literature on the pharmacology and toxicology. We aim at bringing together most of the available scientific research conducted on this species, which is currently scattered across various publications, into this review paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 SAAB.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the response of metabolic rate to temperature is essential for understanding thermal ecology and metabolic adaptation. Although the Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the effects of temperature on reaction rates and metabolic traits, it does not adequately describe two aspects of the thermal performance curve (TPC) for metabolic rate—that metabolic rate is a unimodal function of temperature often with maximal values in the biologically relevant temperature range and that activation energies are temperature dependent. We show that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate in ectotherms is well described by an enzyme-assisted Arrhenius (EAAR) model that accounts for the temperature-dependent contribution of enzymes to decreasing the activation energy required for reactions to occur. The model is mechanistically derived using the thermodynamic rules that govern protein stability. We contrast our model with other unimodal functions that also can be used to describe the temperature dependence of metabolic rate to show how the EAAR model provides an important advance over previous work. We fit the EAAR model to metabolic rate data for a variety of taxa to demonstrate the model's utility in describing metabolic rate TPCs while revealing significant differences in thermodynamic properties across species and acclimation temperatures. Our model advances our ability to understand the metabolic and ecological consequences of increases in the mean and variance of temperature associated with global climate change. In addition, the model suggests avenues by which organisms can acclimate and adapt to changing thermal environments. Furthermore, the parameters in the EAAR model generate links between organismal level performance and underlying molecular processes that can be tested for in future work.},

In the context of microbes, invasions remain poorly understood despite being increasingly recognized as important. To shed light on the factors affecting the success of microbial community invasions, we perform simulations using an individual-based nearly neutral model that combines ecological and evolutionary processes. Our simulations qualitatively recreate many empirical patterns and lead to a description of five general rules of invasion: (1) larger communities evolve better invaders and better defenders; (2) where invader and resident fitness difference is large, invasion success is essentially deterministic; (3) propagule pressure contributes to invasion success, if and only if, invaders and residents are competitively similar; (4) increasing the diversity of invaders has a similar effect to increasing the number of invaders; and (5) more diverse communities more successfully resist invasion.},

abstract = {The concept of alternative stable states has long been a dominant framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in community assembly. This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, much of this work examines the coexistence of just pairs of competitors. This approach ignores those mechanisms of coexistence that emerge only in diverse competitive networks. Despite the potential for these mechanisms to create conditions under which the loss of one competitor triggers the loss of others, we lack the knowledge needed to judge their importance for coexistence in nature.

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the lag time, specific growth rate, and asymptote (growth yield) as a function of temperature. The objective of this research was to determine the suitability and usefulness of different models, either available from the literature or newly developed. The models were compared by using an F test, by which the lack of fit of the models was compared with the measuring error. From the results, a hyperbolic model was selected for the description of the lag time as a function of temperature. Modified forms of the Ratkowsky model were selected as the most suitable model for both the growth rate and the asymptote as a function of temperature. The selected models could be used to predict experimentally determined numbers of organisms as a function of temperature and time.},

abstract = {Abstract The postmining rehabilitation of coastal sand dunes north of Richards Bay (28°43′S, 32°12′E), South Africa, is resulting in the development of a series of known-aged stands of vegetation dominated by Acacia karroo (sweet thorn). Other broad-leaved species are establishing themselves in rehabilitating areas more than 12 years of age. Soils from rehabilitating stands 3–5, 9–12, 13–15, and 16–18 years of age, from two disturbed, unmined stands 30 and 58 years of age, and from a mature unmined stand were examined to assess age-related trends in selected soil properties. Individually, these stands represent a series of different developmental stages of a coastal dune successional sere. Soil organic material, percentage organic carbon and concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and nitrogen increased with an increase in habitat regeneration age. Concentrations of most of these elements were lower than those recorded on the 58-year-old unmined and mature unmined stands. Multivariate analyses suggest, however, that the similarity of these values for rehabilitating stands to those for the unmined stands increased with an increase in regeneration age. The growth response of Raphanus sativus (radish) plants, based on mass attained under experimental growing conditions in soil collected from these stands, suggests an increase in soil fertility with an increase in regeneration age.},

To maintain metabolic rates compatible with sustained life, they have improved the dynamics of their protein structures, thereby enabling appropriate molecular motions required for biological activity at low temperatures. As a consequence of this structural flexibility, psychrophilic proteins are unstable and heat-labile. In the upper range of biological temperatures, thermophiles and hyperthermophiles grow at temperatures {\textgreater} 100 °C and synthesize ultra-stable proteins. However, thermophilic enzymes are nearly inactive at room temperature as a result of their compactness and rigidity. At the molecular level, both types of extremophilic proteins have adapted the same structural factors, but in opposite directions, to address either activity at low temperatures or stability in hot environments. A model based on folding funnels is proposed accounting for the stability-activity relationships in extremophilic proteins. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

IUE observations and archival data are used for the UV template spectra. The optical spectra are from ground-based observations obtained in apertures that match closely the 200 arcsec{\^{}}2{\^{}} IUE aperture. The templates of quiescent galaxies are built according to morphological type, elliptical, bulge, S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc, and the templates of starburst galaxies according to color excess. The unprecedented characteristics of these templates is that UV and optical spectra have been obtained in matched apertures to produce consistent spectral information from 1200 to 10,000 A, Despite the relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well represented in the elliptical, S0, Sa, and Sc, and in the starburst templates. The spectra are available digitally. The UV-optical templates can be applied to the classification of high- redshift galaxies and to the identification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies. A subset of our galaxy templates are linked with published data from the radio to the X-ray for galaxies and quasars. A comparison between the quiescent galaxies and the quasars suggests that, in the optical band, the host galaxy is a factor of 10-100 fainter in flux than the quasar.},

To enhance our understanding of these relationships, we took advantage of the fully sequenced genomes of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Methanococcus maripaludis to produce and analyze the first multispecies stoichiometric metabolic model. Model results were compared to data on growth of the co-culture on lactate in the absence of sulfate. The model accurately predicted several ecologically relevant characteristics, including the flux of metabolites and the ratio of D. vulgaris to M. maripaludis cells during growth. In addition, the model and our data suggested that it was possible to eliminate formate as an interspecies electron shuttle, but hydrogen transfer was essential for syntrophic growth. Our work demonstrated that reconstructed metabolic networks and stoichiometric models can serve not only to predict metabolic fluxes and growth phenotypes of single organisms, but also to capture growth parameters and community composition of simple bacterial communities. {\textcopyright} 2007 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73{\%} of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93{\%} of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift.},

It is based on two stellar absorption line indices, the 4000 Angstrom break strength and the Balmer absorption line index Hdelta{\_}A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95{\%} confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40{\%}. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 Angstrom break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses $\backslash${\~{}}5$\backslash$times 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sol, half light radii {\~{}}3 kpc, and half- light surface mass densities {\~{}}10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sol/kpc{\^{}}2.

We have recently shown that in the most likely metabolic state the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution law while complying with the principle of maximum entropy production. To demonstrate that a metabolic network evolves towards such state we have carried out adaptive evolution experiments with Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum operating with a reduced metabolic functionality based on a reduced set of elementary modes. In such reduced metabolic network metabolic fluxes can be conveniently computed from the measured metabolite secretion pattern. Over a time span of 300 generations the specific growth rate of the strain continuously increased together with a continuous increase in the rate of entropy production. We show that the rate of entropy production asymptotically approaches the maximum entropy production rate predicted from the state when the usage probability of individual elementary modes is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, the outcome of evolution of a complex biological system can be predicted in highly quantitative terms using basic statistical mechanical principles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Microbes form complex communities that perform critical roles for the integrity of their environment or the well-being of their hosts. Controlling these microbial communities can help us restore natural ecosystems and maintain healthy human microbiota. However, the lack of an efficient and systematic control framework has limited our ability to manipulate these microbial communities. Here we fill this gap by developing a control framework based on the new notion of structural accessibility. Our framework uses the ecological network of the community to identify minimum sets of its driver species, manipulation of which allows controlling the whole community. We numerically validate our control framework on large communities, and then we demonstrate its application for controlling the gut microbiota of gnotobiotic mice infected with Clostridium difficile and the core microbiota of the sea sponge Ircinia oros. Our results provide a systematic pipeline to efficiently drive complex microbial communities towards desired states.},

abstract = {Organisms—especially microbes—tend to live together in ecosystems. While some of these ecosystems are very biodiverse, others are not, and while some are very stable over time, others undergo strong temporal fluctuations. Despite a long history of research and a plethora of data, it is not fully understood what determines the biodiversity and stability of ecosystems. Theory and experiments suggest a connection between species interaction, biodiversity and the stability of ecosystems, where an increase in ecosystem stability with biodiversity could be observed in several cases. However, what causes these connections remains unclear. Here, we show in microbial ecosystems in the laboratory that the concentrations of available nutrients can set the strength of interactions between bacteria. High nutrient concentrations allowed the bacteria to strongly alter the chemical environment, causing on average more negative interactions between species. These stronger interactions excluded more species from the community, resulting in a loss of biodiversity. At the same time, the stronger interactions also decreased the stability of the microbial communities, providing a mechanistic link between species interaction, biodiversity and stability in microbial ecosystems.},

Meanwhile the efficacy of FMT for treating chronic diseases associated with microbial dysbiosis has so far been modest with a much higher variability in patient response. Notably, a number of studies suggest that FMT success is dependent on the microbial diversity and composition of the stool donor, leading to the proposition of the existence of FMT super-donors. The identification and subsequent characterization of super-donor gut microbiomes will inevitably advance our understanding of the microbial component of chronic diseases and allow for more targeted bacteriotherapy approaches in the future. Here, we review the evidence for super-donors in FMT and explore the concept of keystone species as predictors of FMT success. Possible effects of host-genetics and diet on FMT engraftment and maintenance are also considered. Finally, we discuss the potential long-term applicability of FMT for chronic disease and highlight how super-donors could provide the basis for dysbiosis-matched FMTs.},

While each of these states is generally resilient, certain perturbations such as antibiotics, probiotics, and diet shifts, result in transitions to other states. Can we reliably both predict such stable states as well as direct and control transitions between them? Here we present a new conceptual model—inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and economics—in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable states, each state with a different species' abundance profile. Our model's core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes' nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions, triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe. Further, using an example of seven Bacteroides species common to the human gut utilizing nine polysaccharides, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances.},

The first part of the book introduces biological basics, such as metabolism, signaling, gene expression, and control as well as mathematical modeling fundamentals, including deterministic models and thermodynamics. The text also discusses linear regression methods, explains the differences between linear and nonlinear regression, and illustrates how to determine input variables to improve estimation accuracy during experimental design. The second part covers intracellular processes, including enzymatic reactions, polymerization processes, and signal transduction. The author highlights the process-function-behavior sequence in cells and shows how modeling and analysis of signal transduction units play a mediating role between process and function. The third part presents theoretical methods that address the dynamics of subsystems and the behavior near a steady state. It covers techniques for determining different time scales, sensitivity analysis, structural kinetic modeling, and theoretical control engineering aspects, including a method for robust control. It also explores frequent patterns (motifs) in biochemical networks, such as the feed-forward loop in the transcriptional network of E. coli. Moving on to models that describe a large number of individual reactions, the last part looks at how these cellular models are used in biotechnology.

This observation is consistent with the evolution of cooperation within species [5], and there is now an increasing emphasis on the importance of cooperation between different microbial species [4, 6]. We lack, however, a systematic test of the importance of mutually positive interactions between different species, which is vital for assessing the commonness and importance of cooperative evolution in natural communities. Here, we study the extent of mutually positive interaction among bacterial strains isolated from a common aquatic environment. Using data collected from two independent experiments evaluating community productivity across diversity gradients, we show that (1) in pairwise species combinations, the great majority of interactions are net negative and (2) there is no evidence that strong higher-order positive effects arise when more than two species are mixed together. Our data do not exclude the possibility of positive effects in one direction where one species gains at the expense of another, i.e., predator-prey-like interactions. However, these do not constitute cooperation and our analysis suggests that the typical result of adaptation to other microbial species will be competitive, rather than cooperative, phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} is smaller than the velocity sampling {\$}\backslashDelta V{\$}, which is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when {\$}\backslashsigma{\textless}\backslashDelta V/2{\$}, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with {\$}\backslashsigma\backslashll\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}, for galaxy redshift determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

However, we have little understanding of when a particular outcome might be expected.

abstract = {Stem cell-based therapy has recently emerged for use in novel therapeutics for incurable diseases. For successful recovery from neurologic diseases, the most pivotal factor is differentiation and directed neuronal cell growth. In this study, we fabricated three different widths of a micro-pattern on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; 1, 2, and 4 microm). Surface modification of the PDMS was investigated for its capacity to manage proliferation and differentiation of neural-like cells from umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-MSCs). Among the micro-patterned PDMS fabrications, the 1 microm-patterned PDMS significantly increased cell proliferation and most of the cells differentiated into neuronal cells. In addition, the 1 microm-patterned PDMS induced an increase in cytosolic calcium, while the differentiated cells on the flat and 4 microm-patterned PDMS had no response. PDMS with a 1 microm pattern was also aligned to direct orientation within 10 degrees angles. Taken together, micro-patterned PDMS supported UCB-MSC proliferation and induced neural like-cell differentiation. Our data suggest that micro-patterned PDMS might be a guiding method for stem cell therapy that would improve its therapeutic action in neurological diseases.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is currently under threat from human population expansion and the required land transformation for shelter and resources. Land transformation, in the form of agriculture or urbanisation is believed to reduce habitats and their resources, increase fragmentation of natural habitats, and increase the likelihood of successful invasion by exotic species. These all affect existing biodiversity, its structure, and the ecosystem services which it provides. In recent years, development from natural and agricultural (mainly sugarcane) land into eco-estates (housing developments with the intention of conserving the environment) has become increasingly popular along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. However, research on their impacts on the local environment is limited. We predicted that these eco-estates are, by their design, improving the functional diversity of amphibians, birds, and mammals, and ultimately ecosystem functioning. A multi-taxa assessment of the three components of functional diversity (functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence) suggested that eco-estate development was improving certain components for each of the taxa assessed. However, the management and development of these eco-estates was the key determinant. Eco-estates with increased interconnected indigenous forest and thicket/dense bush, with reduced housing and road density, exhibited improved functional diversity in comparison with those more densely inhabited containing isolated natural land-cover patches. We believe that these eco-estates could provide an effective mitigation method of population expansion whilst maintaining ecosystem health, but only under the recommended development and management plans.},

abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the "maximum specific growth rate" on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the "maximum specific growth rate." Different methods to determine the "lag time" often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or a w, need not be "multiplicative" and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being "mechanistic" are perfectly suitable for this purpose. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations.

abstract = {The classical Michaelis-Menten model is widely used as the basis for modeling of a number of biological systems. As the model does not consider the inhibitory effect of endproducts that accumulate in virtually all bioprocesses, it is often modified to prevent the overestimation of reaction rates when products have accumulated. Traditional approaches of model modification use the inclusion of irreversible, competitive, and noncompetitive inhibition factors. This article demonstrates that these inhibition factors are insufficient to predict product inhibition of reactions that are close the dynamic equilibrium. All models investigated were found to violate thermodynamic laws as they predicted positive reaction rates for reactions that were endergonic due to high endproduct concentrations. For modeling of biological processes that operate close to the dynamic equilibrium (e.g., anaerobic processes), it is critical to prevent the prediction of positive reaction rates when the reaction has already reached the dynamic equilibrium. This can be achieved by using a reversible kinetic model. However, the major drawback of the reversible kinetic model is the large number of empirical parameters it requires. These parameters are difficult to determine and prone to experimental error. For this reason, the reversible model is not practical in the modeling of biological processes.This article uses the fundamentals of steady-state kinetics and thermodynamics to establish an equation for the reversible kinetic model that is of practical use in bio-process modeling. The behavior of this equilibrium-based model is compared with Michaelis-Menten-based models that use traditional inhibition factors. The equilibrium-based model did not require any empirical inhibition factor to correctly predict when reaction rates must be zero due to the free energy change being zero. For highly exergonic reactions, the equilibrium-based model did not deviate significantly from the Michaelis-Menten model, whereas, for reactions close to equilibrium, the reaction rate was mainly controlled by the quotient of mass action ratio (concentration of all products over concentration of all substrates) over the equilibrium constant K. This quotient is a measure of the displacement of the reaction from its equilibrium. As the new equation takes into account all of the substrates and products, it was able to predict the inhibitor effect of multiple endproducts. The model described is designed to be a useful basis for a number of different model applications where reaction conditions are close to equilibrium.},

Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

Simultaneous invasions might have synergistic effects, for example if resident species need to exhibit divergent phenotypes to compete with the invasive populations. We used three phylogenetically diverse bacterial species to invade two compositionally distinct communities in a controlled, naturalised in vitro system. By initiating the invader introductions at different stages of succession, we could disentangle the relative importance of resident community structure, invader diversity and time pre-invasion.

abstract = {This paper summarises recent trends in predictive modelling of microbial lag phenomena. The lag phase is approached from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. First, a definition of lag and an analysis of the prevailing measuring techniques for the determination of lag time is presented. Furthermore, based on experimental results presented in literature, factors influencing the lag phase are discussed. Major modelling approaches concerning lag phase estimation are critically assessed. In predictive microbiology, a two-step modelling approach is used. Primary models describe the evolution of microbial numbers with time and can be subdivided into deterministic and stochastic models. Primary deterministic models, e.g., Baranyi and Roberts [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23 (1994) 277], Hills and Wright [J. Theor. Biol. 168 (1994) 31] and McKellar [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 36 (1997) 179], describe the evolution of microorganisms, using one single (deterministic) set of model parameters. In stochastic models, e.g., Buchanan et al.

Secondary models describe the relation between primary model parameters and influencing factors (e.g., environmental conditions).

abstract = {Body size determines key behavioral and life history traits across species, as well as interactions between individuals within and between species. Therefore, variation in sizes of immigrants, by exerting variation in trophic interaction strengths, may drive the trajectory and outcomes of community assembly. Here, I study the effects of size variation in the immigration pool on assembly dynamics and equilibrium distributions of sizes and consumer-resource size-ratios using a general mathematical model. I find that because small sizes both, improve the ability to invade and destabilize the community, invasibility and stability pull body size distributions in opposite directions, favoring an increase in both size and size-ratios during assembly, and ultimately yielding a right-skewed size and a symmetric size-ratio distribution. In many scenarios, the result at equilibrium is a systematic increase in body sizes and size-ratios with trophic level. Thus these patterns in size structure are 'signatures' of dynamically constrained, non-neutral community assembly. I also show that for empirically feasible distributions of body sizes in the immigration pool, immigration bias in body sizes cannot counteract dynamical constraints during assembly and thus signatures emerge consistently. I test the theoretical predictions using data from nine terrestrial and aquatic communities and find strong evidence that natural communities do indeed exhibit such signatures of dynamically constrained assembly. Overall, the results provide new measures to detect general, non-neutral patterns in community assembly dynamics, and show that in general, body size is dominant trait that strongly influences assembly and recovery of natural communities and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of metabolic rate to temperature constrains the climate in which ectotherms can function, yet the temperature dependence of metabolic rate may evolve in response to biotic and abiotic factors. We compiled a dataset on the temperature dependence of metabolic rate for heterotrophic ectotherms from studies that show a peak in metabolic rate at an optimal temperature (i.e. that describe the thermal performance curve for metabolic rate). We found that peak metabolic rates were lower in aquatic than terrestrial habitats and increased with body mass, latitude and the optimal temperature. In addition, the optimal temperature decreased with latitude. These results support competing hypotheses about metabolic rate adaptation, with hotter being better in the tropics but colder being better towards the poles. Moreover, our results suggest that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate is more complex than previously suggested.},

The majority of the star formation in the low redshift universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10{\^{}}10-10{\^{}}11 Msun), typically in HSB disk galaxies. Roughly 15{\%} of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20{\%} occurs in starburst galaxies. We show that the present to past-average star formation rate, the Scalo b-parameter; is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 Msun.

In agreement with other work we find a correlation between {\$}b{\$} and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000AA break (D4000) and b.

abstract = {Inulin-type fructans (ITF) and arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) are broken down to different extents by various bifidobacterial strains present in the human colon. To date, phenotypic heterogeneity in the consumption of these complex oligosaccharides at the strain level remains poorly studied. To examine mechanistic variations in ITF and AXOS constituent preferences present in one individual, ITF and AXOS consumption by bifidobacterial strains isolated from the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME) after inoculation with feces from one healthy individual was investigated. Among the 18 strains identified, four speciesindependent clusters displaying different ITF and AXOS degradation mechanisms and preferences were found. Bifidobacterium bifidum B46 showed limited growth on all substrates, whereas B. longum B24 and B. longum B18 could grow better on short-chain-length fractions of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) than on fructose. B. longum B24 could cleave arabinose substituents of AXOS extracellularly, without using the AXOS-derived xylose backbones, whereas B. longum B18 was able to consume oligosaccharides (up to xylotetraose) preferentially and consumed AXOS to a limited extent. B. adolescentis B72 degraded all fractions of FOS simultaneously, partially degraded inulin, and could use xylose backbones longer than xylotetraose extracellularly. The strain-specific degradation mechanisms were suggested to be complementary and indicated resource partitioning. Specialization in the degradation of complex carbohydrates by bifidobacteria present on the individual level could have in vivo implications for the successful implementation of ITF and AXOS, aiming at bifidogenic and/or butyrogenic effects. Finally, this work shows the importance of taking microbial strain-level differences into account in gut microbiota research.},

abstract = {There is currently unprecedented interest in quantifying variation in thermal physiology among organisms, especially in order to understand and predict the biological impacts of climate change. A key parameter in this quantification of thermal physiology is the performance or value of a rate, across individuals or species, at a common temperature (temperature normalisation). An increasingly popular model for fitting thermal performance curves to data-the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation-can yield strongly inflated estimates of temperature-normalised rate values. These deviations occur whenever a key thermodynamic assumption of the model is violated, i.e., when the enzyme governing the performance of the rate is not fully functional at the chosen reference temperature. Using data on 1,758 thermal performance curves across a wide range of species, we identify the conditions that exacerbate this inflation. We then demonstrate that these biases can compromise tests to detect metabolic cold adaptation, which requires comparison of fitness or rate performance of different species or genotypes at some fixed low temperature. Finally, we suggest alternative methods for obtaining unbiased estimates of temperature-normalised rate values for meta-analyses of thermal performance across species in climate change impact studies.},

Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99{\%} of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This conversion is accomplished by networks of biochemical reactions cutting across cellular functions, such as metabolism, gene expression, transport and signalling. Mathematical modelling is a powerful tool for gaining an understanding of the functioning of this large and complex system and the role played by individual constituents and mechanisms. This requires models of microbial growth that provide an integrated view of the reaction networks and bridge the scale from individual reactions to the growth of a population. In this review, we derive a general framework for the kinetic modelling of microbial growth from basic hypotheses about the underlying reaction systems. Moreover, we show that several families of approximate models presented in the literature, notably flux balance models and coarse-grained whole-cell models, can be derived with the help of additional simplifying hypotheses. This perspective clearly brings out how apparently quite different modelling approaches are related on a deeper level, and suggests directions for further research.},

Recent technological advances have enabled elucidation of community diversity at high resolution. Investigation of microbial communities has revealed that they often contain multiple members with complementing and seemingly redundant metabolic capabilities. An understanding of the communal impacts of redundant metabolic capabilities is currently lacking; specifically, it is not known whether metabolic redundancy will foster competition or motivate cooperation. By investigating methanogenic populations, we identified the multidimensional interspecies interactions that define composition and dynamics within syntrophic communities that play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Species-specific genomes were extracted from metagenomic data using differential coverage binning. We used metabolic modeling leveraging metatranscriptomic information to reveal and quantify a complex intertwined system of syntrophic relationships. Our results show that amino acid auxotrophies create additional interdependencies that define community composition and control carbon and energy flux through the system while simultaneously contributing to overall community robustness. Strategic use of antimicrobials further reinforces this intricate interspecies network. Collectively, our study reveals the multidimensional interactions in syntrophic communities that promote high species richness and bolster community stability during environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Soil ecosystems worldwide are subjected to marked modifications caused by anthropogenic disturbances and global climate change, resulting in microbial diversity loss and alteration of ecosystem functions. Despite the paucity of studies, restoration ecology provides an appropriate framework for testing the potential of manipulating soil microbial communities for the recovery of ecosystem functioning. We used a reciprocal transplant design in experimentally altered microbial communities to investigate the effectiveness of introducing microbial communities in degraded soil ecosystems to restore N-cycle functioning. Microbial diversity loss resulted in alternative compositional states associated with impaired N-cycle functioning. Here, the addition of complex microbial communities to these altered communities revealed a pivotal role of deterministic community assembly processes. The diversity of some alternative compositional states was successfully increased but without significant restoration of soil N-cycle functioning. However, in the most degraded alternative state, the introduction of new microbial communities caused an overall decrease in phylogenetic diversity and richness. The successful soil colonization by newly introduced species for some compositional states indicates that priority effects could be overridden when attempting to manipulate microbial communities for soil restoration. Altogether, our result showed consistent patterns within restoration treatments with minor idiosyncratic effects. This suggests the predominance of deterministic processes and the predictability of restoration trajectories, which could be used to guide the effective management of microbial community assemblages for ecological restoration of soils.},

abstract = {Recent research has expanded our understanding of microbial community assembly. However, the field of community ecology is inaccessible to many microbial ecologists because of inconsistent and often confusing terminology as well as unnecessarily polarizing debates. Thus, we review recent literature on microbial community assembly, using the framework of Vellend (Q. Rev. Biol. 85:183-206, 2010) in an effort to synthesize and unify these contributions. We begin by discussing patterns in microbial biogeography and then describe four basic processes (diversification, dispersal, selection, and drift) that contribute to community assembly. We also discuss different combinations of these processes and where and when they may be most important for shaping microbial communities. The spatial and temporal scales of microbial community assembly are also discussed in relation to assembly processes. Throughout this review paper, we highlight differences between microbes and macroorganisms and generate hypotheses describing how these differences may be important for community assembly. We end by discussing the implications of microbial assembly processes for ecosystem function and biodiversity.},

The number of spoilage bacteria present when stored at 35 °C was significantly greater than when stored at lower temperatures, and maximum population size was achieved after 10 h. However, Bacillus pumilus, Dickeya zeae, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. Carotovorum Pcc21, and Bacillus pumilus (RDA-R) did not grow at the storage temperature of 5 °C. The biofilm formation by Clavibacter michiganensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and A. calcoaceticus (RDA-R) are higher than other spoilage bacteria. Biofilm formation showed low correlation between hydrophobicity, and no significant correlation with colony spreading. These results might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures, and could be basic information on the growth characteristics and biofilm formation properties of spoilage bacteria from fresh produce. Practical Application: Growth of spoilage bacteria was different depending on the bacteria strains and storage temperature. Between biofilm formation and cell hydrophobicity was low correlation on spoilage bacteria. Therefore, growth characteristics and biofilm formation of spoilage bacteria might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures.},

Community assembly theory, and metacommunity theory in particular, provides a framework for understanding the ecological dynamics of the human microbiome, such as compositional variability within and between hosts. We explore three core scenarios of human microbiome assembly: development in infants, representing assembly in previously unoccupied habitats; recovery from antibiotics, representing assembly after disturbance; and invasion by pathogens, representing assembly in the context of invasive species.

We focus on the differences in several properties between galaxies that show the auroral line [OIII]$\lambda$4363 and those that do not present this feature in their spectra. It turns out that objects without this auroral line are more luminous, are more metal-rich and present a lower ionization degree. The underlying population is found to be much more important for objects without the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 line, and the effective temperature of the ionizing star clusters of galaxies not showing the auroral line is probably lower. We also study the subsample of HII galaxies whose properties most closely resemble the properties of the intermediate-redshift population of luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs). The objects from this subsample are more similar to the objects not showing the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 line. It might therefore be expected that the intermediate-redshift population of LCBGs is powered by very massive, yet somewhat aged, star clusters. The oxygen abundance of LCBGs would be greater than the average oxygen abundance of local HII galaxies.},

abstract = {Recent theory and experiments have reported a reproducible tendency for the coexistence of microbial species under controlled environmental conditions. This observation has been explained in the context of competition for resources and metabolic complementarity given that, in microbial communities (MCs), many excreted by-products of metabolism may also be resources. MCs therefore play a key role in promoting their own stability and in shaping the niches of the constituent taxa. We suggest that an intermediate level of organization between the species and the community level may be pervasive, where tightly knit metabolic interactions create discrete consortia that are stably maintained. We call these units Metabolically Cohesive Consortia (MeCoCos) and we discuss the environmental context in which we expect their formation, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of their existence. We argue that the ability to identify MeCoCos would open new avenues to link the species-, community- and ecosystem-level properties, with consequences for our understanding of microbial ecology and evolution, and an improved ability to predict ecosystem functioning in the wild.

abstract = {Natural ecological communities are diverse, complex and often surprisingly stable, but the mechanisms underlying their stability remain a theoretical enigma. Interactions such as competition and predation presumably structure communities, yet theory predicts that complex communities are only stable when species growth rates are mostly limited by intraspecific self-regulation rather than by interactions with resources, competitors and predators. Current theory, however, only considers the network topology of population-level interactions between species and neglects within-population differences among juvenile and adult individuals. Here, using model simulations, I show that including commonly observed differences in vulnerability to predation and foraging efficiency between juvenile and adult individuals results in up to ten times larger, more complex communities than in simulations without population stage-structure. These diverse communities are stable or fluctuate with limited amplitude, even though in the model only a single basal species is self-regulated and the population-level interaction network is highly connected. Analysis of the species interaction matrix predicts the simulated communities to be unstable but extending the matrix with a population structure subsystem reveals that dynamic changes in population stage-structure completely cancel out this instability. Common differences between juveniles and adults and fluctuations in their relative abundance hence have a decisive influence on the stability of complex natural communities and their vulnerability when environmental conditions change. Thus, community persistence can not be explained by the network of interactions between the constituting species alone.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quan-titatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

abstract = {Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in biphasic growth curves called "diauxic shifts" that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.},

However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Studies of evolutionary responses to novel environments typically consider single species or perhaps pairs of interacting species. However, all organisms co-occur with many other species, resulting in evolutionary dynamics that might not match those predicted using single species approaches. Recent theories predict that species interactions in diverse systems can influence how component species evolve in response to environmental change. In turn, evolution might have consequences for ecosystem functioning. We used experimental communities of five bacterial species to show that species interactions have a major impact on adaptation to a novel environment in the laboratory. Species in communities diverged in their use of resources compared with the same species in monocultures and evolved to use waste products generated by other species. This generally led to a trade-off between adaptation to the abiotic and biotic components of the environment, such that species evolving in communities had lower growth rates when assayed in the absence of other species. Based on growth assays and on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of resource use, all species evolved more in communities than they did in monocultures. The evolutionary changes had significant repercussions for the functioning of these experimental ecosystems: communities reassembled from isolates that had evolved in polyculture were more productive than those reassembled from isolates that had evolved in monoculture. Our results show that the way in which species adapt to new environments depends critically on the biotic environment of co-occurring species. Moreover, predicting how functioning of complex ecosystems will respond to an environmental change requires knowing how species interactions will evolve. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lawrence et al.},

abstract = {In the process of dredge mining, employed since 1977 on the Zululand coast, heavy minerals are extracted from the dunes after the complete removal of the existing vegetation. The tailings are then reshaped to approximate their original contours, covered with topsoil and revegetated with a cereal cover crop, together with indigenous seeds of long-lived (woody) species. The existence of stands of different ages over a recorded period provided an opportunity to study changes in species composition and vegetation dynamics. Five random 10 × 10m quadrats were sampled in stands of age 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years respectively, and cover data were used for multivariate analysis using TWINSPAN and DECORANA. Importance values of each species, and total and mean species richness were also calculated. Pre-mined and mined soil samples were analysed for trace elements, organic matter and pH. Recently rehabilitated areas of 4 to 5 years were dominated by Acacia karroo, but species richness showed a progressive increase with age of rehabilitated stands, with more woody species in the older stands and a slight decline in dominance of A. karroo. TWINSPAN classified older and younger stands into distinct groups which were related to a chronological succession gradient, also shown by the DECORANA ordination. Some soil nutrients of rehabilitated areas compared favourably with the pre-mined topsoil and subsoil, but percentage organic matter content was still higher in natural dune forests. Increases in soil nutrients suggest that nutrient retention and the establishment of substantial soil flora and fauna are occurring, providing evidence for the sustainability of the soils.

abstract = {Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a method to directly change the recipient's gut microbiota to normalize the composition and gain a therapeutic benefit. The history of FMT has been traced back to the 4th century and has been highly regarded since 2013, when the United States Food and Drug Administration approved FMT for treating recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection. Since then, the range of FMT applications extended rapidly and broadly not only in gastrointestinal disorders, but also in extra-gastrointestinal diseases. Donor selection with questionnaire, interview, blood tests, and stool examinations should be strictly performed before FMT to reduce and prevent occurrence of any adverse events. Step-by-step cautious fecal and recipient preparation along with adequately choosing delivery methods based on individual clinical situations are key points of the FMT process. Although current evidence deems FMT as a generally safe therapeutic method with few adverse effects, the long-term outcomes of FMT have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, establishing periodicity and length of regular follow-up after FMT to monitor the clinical efficacy and long-term adverse events are other essential issues. In the future, we will look forward to personalized FMT for different patients and conditions according to varied hosts and diseases.},

The ability to predict the structure of these complex communities is crucial to understanding and managing them. Here, we propose a simple, qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic microbial communities composed of up to eight soil bacterial species. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions. Survival in three-species competitions was predicted by the pairwise outcomes with an accuracy of {\~{}}90{\%}. Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between sets of seven or all eight species required incorporating additional information regarding the outcomes of the three-species competitions. Our results demonstrate experimentally the ability of a simple bottom-up approach to predict community structure. Such an approach is key for anticipating the response of communities to changing environments, designing interventions to steer existing communities to more desirable states and, ultimately, rationally designing communities de novo.},

Instead, a linear relationship between the square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, √r = b(T-T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria.

abstract = {Landscape connectivity has been shown to alter community assembly and its consequences. Here we examine how strong, sudden changes in connectivity may affect community assembly by conducting experiments on the effects of ''community mixing,'' situations where previously isolated communities become completely connected with consequent community reorganization. Previous theory indicates that assembly history dictates the outcome of mixing: mixing randomly assembled communities leads to a final community with random representation from the original communities, while mixing communities that were assembled via a long history of colonizations and extinctions leads to strong asymmetry, with one community dominating the other. It also predicts that asymmetry should be stronger in the presence of predators in the system. We experimentally tested and explored this theory by mixing aquatic microcosms inhabited by a complex food web of heterotrophic protists, and algae. Our results confirm the prediction that long assembly history can produce asymmetry under mixing and suggest these dynamics could be important in natural systems. However, in contrast to previous theory we also found asymmetry weaker under mixing of communities with more complex trophic structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We have examined the chemistry of a model system of C, H, and O that starts with carbon dioxide and reductants and uses redox couples as the energy source. To inquire into the reaction networks that might emerge, we start with the largest available database of organic molecules, Beilstein on- line, and prune by a set of physical and chemical constraints applicable to the model system. From the 3.5 million entries in Beilstein we emerge with 153 molecules that contain all 11 members of the reductive citric acid cycle. A small number of selection rules generates a very constrained subset, suggesting that this is the type of reaction model that will prove useful in the study of biogenesis. The model indicates that the metabolism shown in the universal chart of pathways may be central to the origin of life, is emergent from organic chemistry, and may be unique.},

abstract = {Understanding the principles that govern the assembly of microbial communities across earth's biomes is a major challenge in modern microbial ecology. This pursuit is complicated by the difficulties of mapping functional roles and interactions onto communities with immense taxonomic diversity and of identifying the scale at which microbes interact [1]. To address this challenge, here, we focused on the bacterial communities that colonize and degrade particulate organic matter in the ocean [2–4]. We show that the assembly of these communities can be simplified as a linear combination of functional modules. Using synthetic polysaccharide particles immersed in natural bacterioplankton assemblages [1, 5], we showed that successional particle colonization dynamics are driven by the interaction of two types of modules: a first type made of narrowly specialized primary degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide composition, and a second type containing substrate-independent taxa whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions—in particular, cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids, and other metabolic byproducts. We show that, as a consequence of this trophic structure, communities can assemble modularly—i.e., by a simple sum of substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex polysaccharide in the particle, connected to a single broad-niche range consumer module. Consistent with this model, a linear combination of the communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results suggest that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade complex organic materials follows simple design principles that could be exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes. Enke et al. show that particle-attached marine microbial communities assemble by recruiting functional groups of taxa in an additive manner. Specialist groups degrade specific polysaccharides, whereas generalist byproduct utilizers invade independently of particle substrate. This simple organization allows prediction of community structure.},

Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

abstract = {To understand the effects of temperature on biological systems, we compile, organize, and analyze a database of 1,072 thermal responses for microbes, plants, and animals. The unprecedented diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15 orders of magnitude), and habitats (all major biomes) in our database allows us to quantify novel features of the temperature response of biological traits. In particular, analysis of the rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses reveals that 87{\%} are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model. The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of 0.65 eV.However, systematic variation in the distribution of rise activation energies is evident, including previously unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic groups, and habitats, and it is partially explained by prey having increased trait performance at lower temperatures relative to predators, suggesting a thermal version of the life-dinner principle - stronger selection on running for your life than running for your dinner. For unimodal responses, habitat (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) largely explains the mean temperature at which trait values are optimal but not variation around the mean. The distribution of activation energies for trait falls has a mean of 1.15 ± 0.39 eV (significantly higher than rises) and is also right-skewed. Our results highlight generalities and deviations in the thermal response of biological traits and help to provide a basis to predict better how biological systems, from cells to communities, respond to temperature change.},

abstract = {Models describing the biotic drivers that create and maintain biological diversity within trophic levels have focused primarily on negative interactions (i.e. competition), leaving marginal room for positive interactions (i.e. facilitation). We show facilitation to be a ubiquitous driver of biodiversity by first noting that all species use resources and thus change the local biotic or abiotic conditions, altering the available multidimensional niches. This can cause a shift in local species composition, which can cause an increase in beta, and sometimes alpha, diversity. We show that these increases are ubiquitous across ecosystems. These positive effects on diversity occur via a broad host of disparate direct and indirect mechanisms. We identify and unify several of these facilitative mechanisms and discuss why it has been easy to underappreciate the importance of facilitation. We show that net positive effects have a long history of being considered ecologically or evolutionarily unstable, and we present recent evidence of its potential stability. Facilitation goes well beyond the common case of stress amelioration and it probably gains importance as community complexity increases. While biodiversity is, in part, created by species exploiting many niches, many niches are available to exploit only because species create them.

abstract = {The ongoing climate change has motivated numerous studies investigating the temperature response of various organisms, especially that of ectotherms. To correctly describe the thermal performance of these organisms, functions are needed which sufficiently fit to the complete optimum curve. Surprisingly, model-comparisons for the temperature-dependence of population growth rates of an important ectothermic group, the protozoa, are still missing. In this study, temperature reaction norms of natural isolates of the freshwater protist Paramecium caudatum were investigated, considering nearly the entire temperature range. These reaction norms were used to estimate thermal performance curves by applying a set of commonly used model functions. An information theory approach was used to compare models and to identify the best ones for describing these data. Our results indicate that the models which can describe negative growth at the high- and low-temperature branch of an optimum curve are preferable. This is a prerequisite for accurately calculating the critical upper and lower thermal limits. While we detected a temperature optimum of around 29 °C for all investigated clonal strains, the critical thermal limits were considerably different between individual clones. Here, the tropical clone showed the narrowest thermal tolerance, with a shift of its critical thermal limits to higher temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the Gibbs free energy change of the substrate transformation that supports the growth of a microbe is decreased when the concentrations of the substrates are decreased and when the concentrations of the products of metabolism are increased. Microbes require a supply of ATP for cell maintenance and growth, and coupling the transformation of substrates to products with the formation of ATP also decreases the magnitude of the Gibbs free energy change. Here we include these three thermodynamic controllers (substrate and product concentration, and ATP formation) in a model of substrate transformation by hydrogenotrophic methanogens that results in a number of realistic behaviours. First, a threshold for substrate use emerges, below which the methanogen cannot metabolise its substrate. Under this model, microbes that capture more of the Gibbs free energy change from substrate transformation in the form of ATP have greater thresholds for their substrate, in line with observations of actual microbes. Second, an apparent saturation constant emerges that is controlled by the thermodynamics of the reaction. This increases with increasing ATP synthesis per substrate, so that methanogens that conserve more ATP grow faster at higher substrate concentrations, but are less competitive at low substrate concentrations. As a result, simply changing the ATP yield (moles of ATP per mole of substrate) results in methanogens with differing ecological strategies through thermodynamic impacts on their metabolism. Third, end-product inhibition through thermodynamic feedback can limit the growth of microbes, and those that capture more ATP per substrate are limited by smaller product concentrations than those that capture less ATP.},

Despite the recognised importance of biotic factors in determining the invasiveness of microbial communities, the success and impact of multiple concurrent invaders on the resident community has not been examined. Simultaneous invasions might have synergistic effects, for example if resident species need to exhibit divergent phenotypes to compete with the invasive populations. We used three phylogenetically diverse bacterial species to invade two compositionally distinct communities in a controlled, naturalised in vitro system. By initiating the invader introductions at different stages of succession, we could disentangle the relative importance of resident community structure, invader diversity and time pre-invasion. Our results indicate that multiple invaders increase overall invasion success, but do not alter the successional trajectory of the whole community.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal of microbial ecology is to understand what determines the diversity, stability, and structure of microbial ecosystems. The microbial context poses special conceptual challenges because of the strong mutual influences between the microbes and their chemical environment through the consumption and production of metabolites. By analyzing a generalized consumer resource model that explicitly includes cross-feeding, stochastic colonization, and thermodynamics, we show that complex microbial communities generically exhibit a transition as a function of available energy fluxes from a “resource-limited” regime where community structure and stability is shaped by energetic and metabolic considerations to a diverse regime where the dominant force shaping microbial communities is the overlap between species' consumption preferences. These two regimes have distinct species abundance patterns, different functional profiles, and respond differently to environmental perturbations. Our model reproduces large-scale ecological patterns observed across multiple experimental settings such as nestedness and differential beta diversity patterns along energy gradients. We discuss the experimental implications of our results and possible connections with disorder-induced phase transitions in statistical physics.},

@article{Baranyi1994,
abstract = {A new member of the family of growth models described by Baranyi et al. (1993a) is introduced in which the physiological state of the cells is represented by a single variable. The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and aw, change with time. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), particularly Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella viridescens and Lactobacillus sakei, are the main spoilage bacteria of refrigerated, vacuum-packed meat products, stored in modified atmosphere, and their growth determines the shelf life length of these products. The objective of this study was to model the growth of L. plantarum, W. viridescens and L. sakei under different isothermal cultivation conditions and establish secondary models to describe the effect of temperature on the growth parameters of these bacteria. The LAB growth was evaluated in culture medium at temperatures of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 30 °C. The fit of Baranyi and Roberts (BAR) and Gompertz (GO) primary models to the growth curves of LAB was compared by statistical indices, in which the BAR model showed slightly better fits to the experimental data. The BAR growth parameters were used to establish the secondary models, $\mu$max and Nmax were established for the three LAB. The power model described the influence of temperature on the parameter $\lambda$ for L. plantarum, and other bacteria showed no lag phase. The growth of LAB was strongly influenced by storage temperature and the obtained models allow predicting the growth of these bacteria within the temperature range from 4 to 30 °C.},

However, tradeoffs depend on genetic background and evolutionary history and can themselves evolve. We present a simple model capable of capturing the key feedback loop: evolutionary history shapes tradeoff strength, which, in turn, shapes evolutionary future. One consequence of this feedback is that genomes with identical fitness can have different evolutionary properties shaped by prior environmental exposure. Another is that, generically, the best adaptations to one environment may evolve in another. Our simple framework bridges the gap between the phenotypic Fisher's Geometric Model and the genotypic properties, such as modularity and evolvability, and can serve as a rich playground for investigating evolution in multiple or changing environments.},

abstract = {Different microbial cell types typically specialize at performing different metabolic processes. A canonical example is substrate cross-feeding, where one cell type consumes a primary substrate into an intermediate and another cell type consumes the intermediate. While substrate cross-feeding is widely observed, its consequences on ecosystem processes is often unclear. How does substrate cross-feeding affect the rate or extent of substrate consumption? We hypothesized that substrate cross-feeding eliminates competition between different enzymes and reduces the accumulation of growth-inhibiting intermediates, thus accelerating substrate consumption. We tested this hypothesis using isogenic mutants of the bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri that either completely consume nitrate to dinitrogen gas or cross-feed the intermediate nitrite. We demonstrate that nitrite cross-feeding eliminates inter-enzyme competition and, in turn, reduces nitrite accumulation. We further demonstrate that nitrite cross-feeding accelerates substrate consumption, but only when nitrite has growth-inhibiting effects. Knowledge about inter-enzyme competition and the inhibitory effects of intermediates could therefore be important for deciding how to best segregate different metabolic processes into different microbial cell types to optimize a desired biotransformation.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

Model selection is underpinned by a philosophical view that understanding can best be approached by simultaneously weighing evidence for multiple working hypotheses.

The dominant paradigm is to generate a null hypothesis (typically one with little biological menaing) and ask whether the hypothesis can be rejected in light of observed data. Rejection occurs when an test statistic generated from observed data falls beyond an arbitrary probability threshold (usually P{\textless}0.05) which is interpreted as tacit support for a biologically more meaningful alternative hypothesis. Hence, the actual hypothesis of interest (the alternative hypothesis) is accepted only in the sense that the null hypothesis is rejected.},

This review addresses both topics by familiarizing readers with key concepts (and terminology) in the construction, validation, and application of deterministic biochemical models, with particular emphasis on a simple enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Networks of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the natural language for describing enzyme kinetics in a mass action approximation.We illustrate this point by showing how the familiar Briggs-Haldane formulation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics derives from the outer (or quasi-steady-state) solution of a dynamical system of ODEs describing a simple reaction under special conditions. We discuss howparameters in the Michaelis-Menten approximation and in the underlying ODE network can be estimated fromexperimental data, with a special emphasis on the origins of uncertainty. Finally, we extrapolate from a simple reaction to complex models of multiprotein biochemical networks. The concepts described in this review, hitherto of interest primarily to practitioners, are likely to become important for a much broader community of cellular andmolecular biologists attempting to understand the promise and challenges of "systems biology" as applied to biochemical mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These more nuanced features have been described in great detail for some specific types of interactions, (e.g. pairwise metabolic cross-feeding, quorum sensing or antibiotic killing), often with the use of quantitative measurements and insight derived from modeling. With a growing understanding of the composition and dynamics of complex microbial communities for human health and other applications, we face the challenge of integrating information about these different interactions into comprehensive quantitative frameworks. Here, we review the literature on a wide set of microbial interactions, and explore the potential value of a formal categorization based on multidimensional vectors of attributes. We propose that such an encoding can facilitate systematic, direct comparisons of interaction mechanisms and dependencies, and we discuss the relevance of an atlas of interactions for future modeling and rational design efforts.},

Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between the square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, √r = b(T-T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds.},

Plenty of such methods have been designed to accomplish this task: most of them deal with undirected and unweighted networks only, but a few are capable of handling directed and/or weighted networks too, thus properly exploiting richer information. In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as DeltaCon and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and NetLSD. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the FAO Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

abstract = {The classical Michaelis-Menten model is widely used as the basis for modeling of a number of biological systems. As the model does not consider the inhibitory effect of endproducts that accumulate in virtually all bioprocesses, it is often modified to prevent the overestimation of reaction rates when products have accumulated. Traditional approaches of model modification use the inclusion of irreversible, competitive, and noncompetitive inhibition factors. This article demonstrates that these inhibition factors are insufficient to predict product inhibition of reactions that are close the dynamic equilibrium. All models investigated were found to violate thermodynamic laws as they predicted positive reaction rates for reactions that were endergonic due to high endproduct concentrations. For modeling of biological processes that operate close to the dynamic equilibrium (e.g., anaerobic processes), it is critical to prevent the prediction of positive reaction rates when the reaction has already reached the dynamic equilibrium. This can be achieved by using a reversible kinetic model. However, the major drawback of the reversible kinetic model is the large number of empirical parameters it requires. These parameters are difficult to determine and prone to experimental error. For this reason, the reversible model is not practical in the modeling of biological processes.This article uses the fundamentals of steady-state kinetics and thermodynamics to establish an equation for the reversible kinetic model that is of practical use in bio-process modeling. The behavior of this equilibrium-based model is compared with Michaelis-Menten-based models that use traditional inhibition factors. The equilibrium-based model did not require any empirical inhibition factor to correctly predict when reaction rates must be zero due to the free energy change being zero. For highly exergonic reactions, the equilibrium-based model did not deviate significantly from the Michaelis-Menten model, whereas, for reactions close to equilibrium, the reaction rate was mainly controlled by the quotient of mass action ratio (concentration of all products over concentration of all substrates) over the equilibrium constant K. This quotient is a measure of the displacement of the reaction from its equilibrium. As the new equation takes into account all of the substrates and products, it was able to predict the inhibitor effect of multiple endproducts. The model described is designed to be a useful basis for a number of different model applications where reaction conditions are close to equilibrium.},

abstract = {The design (synthesis) of analog electrical circuits starts with a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior and requires creating a circuit that satisfies the specified design goals. Analog circuit synthesis entails the creation of both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) of all of the circuit's components. The difficulty of the problem of analog circuit synthesis is well known, and there is no previously known general automated technique for synthesizing an analog circuit from a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior. This paper presents a single uniform approach using genetic programming for the automatic synthesis of both the topology and sizing of a suite of eight different prototypical analog circuits, including a lowpass filter, a crossover (woofer and tweeter) filter, a source identification circuit, an amplifier, a computational circuit, a time-optimal controller circuit, a temperature-sensing circuit, and a voltage reference circuit. The problem-specific information required for each of the eight problems is minimal and consists of the number of inputs and outputs of the desired circuit, the types of available components, and a fitness measure that restates the high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior as a measurable mathematical quantity. The eight genetically evolved circuits constitute an instance of an evolutionary computation technique producing results on a task that is usually thought of as requiring human intelligence. The fact that a single uniform approach yielded a satisfactory design for each of the eight circuits as well as that a satisfactory design was created on the first or second run of each problem are evidence for the general applicability of genetic programming for solving the problem of automatic synthesis of analog electrical circuits. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

Ovipositional and developmental rate functions were used in a temperature-driven, discrete-time, simulation model describing McDaniel spider mite population dynamics. Temperature dependence of the instantaneous population growth rate was determined by fitting the derived rate-temperature function to data generated through simulation at various fixed temperatures. The functional relationship of important population parameters to temperature provided the mechanism for inclusion of phenological effects on mite populations in a synoptic apple pest management model. Two derived functions were fit to several published rate-temperature data sets. Adequacy of description (as indicated by R 2 values) indicated general applicability of both functions for description of temperature-controlled, biological processes. Further, it was concluded that the singular perturbation method of matched asymptotes has potentially wide application in ecology, and an Appendix detailing the application of this method is included.},

abstract = {Soil ecosystems worldwide are subjected to marked modifications caused by anthropogenic disturbances and global climate change, resulting in microbial diversity loss and alteration of ecosystem functions. Despite the paucity of studies, restoration ecology provides an appropriate framework for testing the potential of manipulating soil microbial communities for the recovery of ecosystem functioning. We used a reciprocal transplant design in experimentally altered microbial communities to investigate the effectiveness of introducing microbial communities in degraded soil ecosystems to restore N-cycle functioning. Microbial diversity loss resulted in alternative compositional states associated with impaired N-cycle functioning. Here, the addition of complex microbial communities to these altered communities revealed a pivotal role of deterministic community assembly processes. The diversity of some alternative compositional states was successfully increased but without significant restoration of soil N-cycle functioning. However, in the most degraded alternative state, the introduction of new microbial communities caused an overall decrease in phylogenetic diversity and richness. The successful soil colonization by newly introduced species for some compositional states indicates that priority effects could be overridden when attempting to manipulate microbial communities for soil restoration. Altogether, our result showed consistent patterns within restoration treatments with minor idiosyncratic effects. This suggests the predominance of deterministic processes and the predictability of restoration trajectories, which could be used to guide the effective management of microbial community assemblages for ecological restoration of soils.},

abstract = {The various kinetic rate laws commonly used to describe microbial metabolism are derived considering only forward reaction progress and hence are inconsistent with the requirements of thermodynamics. These laws may be applied without significant error where abundant energy is available to drive the metabolic reaction, so the forward reaction overwhelms the reverse. The laws are, however, unsuitable where little energy may be available. In previous papers we derived a new rate law for microbial respiration considering that reaction progresses simultaneously in both the forward and reverse directions. In this paper, we demonstrate in a new and rigorous way how the rate law can account quantitatively for the thermodynamic driving force for reaction. We refine our previous work on microbial respiration to better account for details of the electron transfer process. We furthermore extend the theory to account for enzymatic reaction and microbial fermentation. We show that commonly used rate laws of simple form can be modified to honor thermodynamic consistency by including a thermodynamic potential factor. Finally, we consider how the rate of biomass synthesis can be determined from the rate of respiration or fermentation. We apply these results to describe (1) the enzymatic reaction by which benzoyl-CoA forms, (2) crotonate fermentation, and (3) glucose fermentation; for each process we demonstrate how the reaction rate is affected by the thermodynamic driving force. Results of the study improve our ability to predict microbial metabolic rates accurately over a spectrum of geochemical environments, including under eutrophic and oligotrophic conditions.},

This work builds on MacArthur's classic model of competitive coexistence to investigate such community-level competition in a minimal theoretical setting. It is shown that the ability of a species to survive a coalescence event is best predicted by a community-level ‘fitness' of its native community rather than the intrinsic performance of the species itself. The model presented here allows formalizing a macroscopic perspective whereby a community harboring organisms at varying abundances becomes equivalent to a single organism expressing genes at different levels. While most natural communities do not satisfy the strict criteria of multicellularity developed by multi-level selection theory, the effective cohesion described here is a generic consequence of resource partitioning, requires no cooperative interactions, and can be expected to be widespread in microbial ecosystems.},

Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions. Survival in three-species competitions was predicted by the pairwise outcomes with an accuracy of {\~{}}90{\%}. Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between sets of seven or all eight species required incorporating additional information regarding the outcomes of the three-species competitions.

abstract = {Classical definitions of syntrophy focus on a process, performed through metabolic interaction between dependent microbial partners, such as the degradation of complex organic compounds under anoxic conditions. However, examples from past and current scientific discoveries suggest that a new, simple but wider definition is necessary to cover all aspects of microbial syntrophy. We suggest the term 'obligately mutualistic metabolism', which still focuses on microbial metabolic cooperation but also includes an ecological aspect: the benefit for both partners. By the combined metabolic activity of microorganisms, endergonic reactions can become exergonic through the efficient removal of products and therefore enable a microbial community to survive with minimal energy resources. Here, we explain the principles of classical and non-classical syntrophy and illustrate the concepts with various examples. We present biochemical fundamentals that allow microorganism to survive under a range of environmental conditions and to drive important biogeochemical processes. Novel technologies have contributed to the understanding of syntrophic relationships in cultured and uncultured systems. Recent research highlights that obligately mutualistic metabolism is not limited to certain metabolic pathways nor to certain environments or microorganisms. This beneficial microbial interaction is not restricted to the transfer of reducing agents such as hydrogen or formate, but can also involve the exchange of organic, sulfurous- and nitrogenous compounds or the removal of toxic compounds. {\textcopyright} 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

This data set has been released in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS spectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra is sufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for individual objects. The typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is 240 km/s, with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent for 93 per cent of BOSS galaxies. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent between redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting massive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this redshift interval. The majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission lines. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams using the emission lines [OII], H $\beta$ , [OIII], Halpha, and [NII] (detected in about 4 per cent of the galaxies). We show that the emission line properties are strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between observed frame colours and emission line properties. Within in the low- z sample around 0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3, half of the emission-line galaxies have LINER-like emission line ratios, followed by Seyfert-AGN dominated spectra, and only a small fraction of a few per cent are purely star forming galaxies. AGN and LINER-like objects, instead, are less prevalent in the high- z sample around 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7, where more than half of the emission line objects are star forming. This is a pure selection effect caused by the non-detection of weak H $\beta$ emission lines in the BOSS spectra. Finally, we show that star forming, AGN and emission line free galaxies are well separated in the g - r vs r - i target selection diagram.},

abstract = {Microbial invasions exhibit many unique properties; notably, entire microbial communities often invade one another, a phenomenon known as community coalescence. In spite of the potential importance of this process for the dynamics and stability of microbiome assembly, our understanding of it is still very limited. Recent theoretical and empirical work has proposed that large microbial communities may exhibit an emergent cohesiveness, as a result of collective consumer-resource interactions and metabolic feedbacks between microbial growth and the environment. A fundamental prediction of this proposal is the presence of ecological co-selection during community coalescence, where the invasion success of a given taxon is determined by its community members. To establish the generality of this prediction in experimental microbiomes, we have performed over one hundred invasion and coalescence experiments with environmental communities of different origins that had spontaneously and stably assembled in two different synthetic aerobic environments. We show that the dominant species of the coalesced communities can both recruit their community members (top-down co-selection) and be recruited by them (bottom-up co-selection) into the coalesced communities. Our results provide direct evidence that collective invasions generically produce ecological co-selection of interacting species, emphasizing the importance of community-level interactions during microbial community assembly.},

abstract = {Surveys of microbial biodiversity such as the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) and the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) have revealed robust ecological patterns across different environments. A major goal in ecology is to leverage these patterns to identify the ecological processes shaping microbial ecosystems. One promising approach is to use minimal models that can relate mechanistic assumptions at the microbe scale to community-level patterns. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the Microbial Consumer Resource Model (MiCRM) – a minimal model for microbial communities with resource competition, metabolic crossfeeding and stochastic colonization – can qualitatively reproduce patterns found in survey data including compositional gradients, dissimilarity/overlap correlations, richness/harshness correlations, and nestedness of community composition. By using the MiCRM to generate synthetic data with different environmental and taxonomical structure, we show that large scale patterns in the EMP can be reproduced by considering the energetic cost of surviving in harsh environments and HMP patterns may reflect the importance of environmental filtering in shaping competition. We also show that recently discovered dissimilarity-overlap correlations in the HMP likely arise from communities that share similar environments rather than reflecting universal dynamics. We identify ecologically meaningful changes in parameters that alter or destroy each one of these patterns, suggesting new mechanistic hypotheses for further investigation. These findings highlight the promise of minimal models for microbial ecology.},

abstract = {Do communities return to their former state when we disturb them? The answer is “surely not always,” since some disturbances may be so devastating that recovery will be impossible. If communities do recover, then how fast is that recovery? Do different subsets of species return at the same rate? Is that rate a simple exponential recovery— meaning that the change toward the original state is fastest when the community is furthest away and it slows as the community converges? Or is recovery a more dynamically complex process? These questions are theoretically interesting and practically important. The theoretical questions are if there is a particular state—some exact composition—to which a community is likely to return, if there might be several (or many) possible such states, or if community composition is essentially haphazard. The practical implication is that if disturbed ecological communities do not tend to return to a previous state, it may be impossible to undo human impacts on natural ecosystems. We follow the fate of species assemblages following the removal of vegetation for mining. We show that these assemblages in restored subtropical coastal dune forests in South Africa do converge with a regional equilibrium state and that convergence is possible within a reasonable period. However, changes in assemblages from different trophic levels were idiosyncratic: convergence in the dung beetle assemblage did not mimic convergence for trees and birds, for example. Few of the assemblages converged exponentially, the simplest shape for the decay function. Furthermore, trends were sometimes different for different indices of community dissimilarity, suggesting that whether one accepts convergence depends, in part, on exactly what one measures.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY This paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a 'true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

abstract = {The dynamics of biological reaction networks are strongly constrained by thermodynamics. An holistic understanding of their behavior and regulation requires mathematical models that observe these constraints. However, kinetic models may easily violate the constraints imposed by the principle of detailed balance, if no special care is taken. Detailed balance demands that in thermodynamic equilibrium all fluxes vanish. We introduce a thermodynamic- kinetic modeling (TKM) formalism that adapts the concepts of potentials and forces from irreversible thermodynamics to kinetic modeling. In the proposed formalism, the thermokinetic potential of a compound is proportional to its concentration. The proportionality factor is a compound-specific parameter called capacity. The thermokinetic force of a reaction is a function of the potentials. Every reaction has a resistance that is the ratio of thermokinetic force and reaction rate. For mass-action type kinetics, the resistances are constant. Since it relies on the thermodynamic concept of potentials and forces, the TKM formalism structurally observes detailed balance for all values of capacities and resistances. Thus, it provides an easy way to formulate physically feasible, kinetic models of biological reaction networks. The TKM formalism is useful for modeling large biological networks that are subject to many detailed balance relations. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Despite numerous surveys of gene and species content in heterotrophic microbial communities, such as those found in animal guts, oceans, or soils, it is still unclear whether there are generalizable biological or ecological processes that control their dynamics and function. Here, we review experimental and theoretical advances to argue that networks of trophic interactions, in which the metabolic excretions of one species are the primary resource for another, constitute the central drivers of microbial community assembly. Trophic interactions emerge from the deconstruction of complex forms of organic matter into a wealth of smaller metabolic intermediates, some of which are released to the environment and serve as a nutritional buffet for the community. The structure of the emergent trophic network and the rate at which primary resources are supplied control many features of microbial community assembly, including the relative contributions of competition and cooperation and the emergence of alternative community states. Viewing microbial community assembly through the lens of trophic interactions also has important implications for the spatial dynamics of communities as well as the functional redundancy of taxonomic groups. Given the ubiquity of trophic interactions across environments, they impart a common logic that can enable the development of a more quantitative and predictive microbial community ecology. What are the principles that underlie the assembly and succession of dynamic and complex microbial communities? In this Review, Gralka et al. lay out a conceptual framework to understand this issue, arguing that networks of trophic interactions constitute the central drivers of microbial community assembly.},

@article{Kettle2015,
abstract = {We present here a first attempt at modelling microbial dynamics in the human colon incorporating both uncertainty and adaptation. This is based on the development of a Monod-equation based, differential equation model, which produces computer simulations of the population dynamics and major metabolites of microbial communities from the human colon. To reduce the complexity of the system, we divide the bacterial community into 10 bacterial functional groups (BFGs) each distinguished by its substrate preferences, metabolic pathways and its preferred pH range. The model simulates the growth of a large number of bacterial strains and incorporates variation in microbiota composition between people, while also allowing succession and enabling adaptation to environmental changes. The model is shown to reproduce many of the observed changes in major phylogenetic groups and key metabolites such as butyrate, acetate and propionate in response to a one unit pH shift in experimental continuous flow fermentors inoculated with human faecal microbiota. Nevertheless, it should be regarded as a learning tool to be updated as our knowledge of bacterial groups and their interactions expands. Given the difficulty of accessing the colon, modelling can play an extremely important role in interpreting experimental data and predicting the consequences of dietary modulation.},

We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (±0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 M☉ h, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 M☉. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H$\alpha$ luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z {\~{}} 0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 M☉. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

While this is generally adequate for strong emission lines, a more sophisticated treatment of the continuum is required to recover weak features and to properly account for the stellar Balmer absorption, which can reach equivalent widths of 5 8 in some galaxies. To address this need, we have designed a special-purpose code optimized for use with SDSS galaxy spectra that fits a stellar population model to the continuum.},

abstract = {Rich ecosystems harbour thousands of species interacting in tangled networks encompassing predation, mutualism and competition. Such widespread biodiversity is puzzling, because in ecological models it is exceedingly improbable for large communities to stably coexist. One aspect rarely considered in these models, however, is that coexisting species in natural communities are a selected portion of a much larger pool, which has been pruned by population dynamics. Here we compute the distribution of the number of species that can coexist when we start from a pool of species interacting randomly, and show that even in this case we can observe rich, stable communities. Interestingly, our results show that, once stability conditions are met, network structure has very little influence on the level of biodiversity attained. Our results identify the main drivers responsible for widespread coexistence in natural communities, providing a baseline for determining which structural aspects of empirical communities promote or hinder coexistence.},

abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero ($\mu$=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (p=constant). The model has four parameters: N(o) (Log10 of initial population density), NMAX (Log10 of final population density), tLAG (time when lag phase ends), and tMAX (time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data for Escherichia coli 0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more 'robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

abstract = {We propose two strategies to characterize organisms with respect to their metabolic capabilities. The first, investigative, strategy describes metabolic networks in terms of their capability to utilize different carbon sources, resulting in the concept of carbon utilization spectra. In the second, predictive, approach minimal nutrient combinations are predicted from the structure of the metabolic networks, resulting in a characteristic nutrient profile. Both strategies allow for a quantification of functional properties of metabolic networks, allowing to identify groups of organisms with similar functions. We investigate whether the functional description reflects the typical environments of the corresponding organisms by dividing all species into disjoint groups based on whether they are aerotolerant and/or photosynthetic. Despite differences in the underlying concepts, both measures display some common features. Closely related organisms often display a similar functional behavior and in both cases the functional measures appear to correlate with the considered classes of environments. Carbon utilization spectra and nutrient profiles are complementary approaches toward a functional classification of organism-wide metabolic networks. Both approaches contain different information and thus yield different clusterings, which are both different from the classical taxonomy of organisms. Our results indicate that a sophisticated combination of our approaches will allow for a quantitative description reflecting the lifestyles of organisms.},

We formulate and experimentally constrain a model in which mediators of interactions (e.g. metabolites or waste-products) are explicitly incorporated. Our model highlights facilitation and self-restraint as interactions that contribute to coexistence, consistent with our intuition. When interactions are strong, we observe that coexistence is determined primarily by the topology of facilitation and inhibition influences not their strengths. Importantly, we show that consumption or degradation of chemical mediators moderates interaction strengths and promotes coexistence.

abstract = {This study proposes and discusses a multi-scale spatial planning method implemented simultaneously at local and national level to prioritize ecosystem management actions across landscapes and seascapes. Mismatches in scale between the occurrence of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, and the size and nature of the human footprint, and the different levels and scope of governance, are a significant challenge in conservation planning. These scale mismatches are further confounded by data resolution disparities across and amongst the different scales. To address this challenge, we developed a multi-resolution scale-linked marine spatial planning method. We tested this approach in the development of a Conservation Plan for a significant portion of South Africa's exclusive economic zone, adjacent to the east coast province of KwaZulu-Natal (the SeaPlan project). The study's dataset integrated the geographic distribution of 390 biodiversity elements (species, habitats, and oceanographic processes) and 38 human activities. A multi-resolution system of planning unit layers (PUL), with individual PUs ranging in resolution from 0.2 to 10 km, was designed to arrange and analyse these data. Spatial priorities for conservation were selected incrementally at different scales, contributing conservation targets from the fine-, medium- and large-scale analyses, and from the coast to the offshore. Compared to a basic single-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our multi-resolution scale-linked method selects 6{\%} less conservation area to achieve the same targets. Compared to a multi-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our method requires only an additional 5{\%} area. Overall, this method reflects the multi-scale nature of marine social-ecological systems more realistically, is relatively simple and replicable, and serves to better connect fine-scale and large-scale spatial management policies. We discuss the impacts of this study on protected area expansion planning processes in South Africa. This study showcases a methodological advance that has the potential to impact marine spatial planning practices and policies.},

Detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is unnecessary for the model's construction, and uniqueness is not a prerequisite either. However, different expressions might be needed for ongoing processes and ones initially undetectable.

In this respect, an analogy between mechanics and thermodynamics has been performed via the definition of the entropy density acceleration expressed by the time derivative of the rate of entropy density and related to heat and matter transfer in minimum living systems. Cells are regarded as open thermodynamic systems that exchange heat and matter resulting from irreversible processes with the intercellular environment. Prigogine's minimum energy dissipation principle is reformulated using the notion of entropy density acceleration applied to glucose catabolism. It is shown that, for out-of-equilibrium states, the calculated entropy density acceleration for a single cell is finite and negative and approaches as a function of time a zero value at global thermodynamic equilibrium for heat and matter transfer independently of the cell type and the metabolic pathway. These results could be important for a deeper understanding of entropy generation and its correlation with heat transfer in cell biology with special regard to glucose catabolism representing the prototype of irreversible reactions and a crucial metabolic pathway in stem cells and cancer stem cells.},

abstract = {A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that shape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many not scale up to large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing smaller systems. To address these shortcomings, we develop a statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources is large. Unlike previous work in this limit, our theory addresses resource dynamics and resource depletion and demonstrates that species generically and consistently perturb their environments and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of collective phenomena on species invasion and ecological stability. Our theory suggests that such phenomena are a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.},

In one population, three clones were isolated and by means of reconstruction experiments were shown to be maintained in stable polymorphism, although they exhibited substantial differences in maximum specific growth rates and in glucose uptake kinetics. Analysis of these three clones revealed that their stable coexistence could be explained by differential patterns of the secretion and uptake of two alternative metabolites acetate and glycerol. Regulatory (constitutive and null) mutations in acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase accounted for different patterns of acetate secretion and uptake seen. Altered patterns in glycerol uptake are most likely explained by mutations which result in quantitative differences in the induction of the glycerol regulon and/or structural changes in glycerol kinase that reduce allosteric inhibition by effector molecules associated with glycolysis. The evolution of resource partitioning, and consequent polymorphisms which arise may illustrate incipient processes of speciation in asexual organisms.},

We perform pairwise growth and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from a model mouse microbiota. We then apply our framework to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur in co-culture. Based on one of the inferences from this framework, we identify and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction and validate that the proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit in vitro. Our results reveal the type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities composed of gut microbes. We focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework can be applied to interspecies interactions that modulate any phenotype of interest within microbial communities. Ecological interactions determine the behavior of microbial communities, but pinpointing mechanisms governing these interactions is difficult. Here, we develop a framework for inferring interspecies metabolic interactions in co-culture based on monoculture behavior and co-culture growth outcomes. We profile the growth and metabolism of monocultures and co-cultures of bacteria from a defined mouse microbiota and apply our framework to these data.

As these interactions often involve a fitness cost, it is unclear how stable cooperation can emerge. Here we use genome-scale metabolic models to investigate whether the release of “costless” metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producer), can be a prominent driver of intermicrobial interactions. By performing over 2 million pairwise growth simulations of 24 species in a combinatorial assortment of environments, we identify a large space of metabolites that can be secreted without cost, thus generating ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative interactions, we show that anoxic conditions can promote mutualisms by providing more opportunities for exchange of costless metabolites, resulting in an overrepresentation of stable ecological network motifs.

abstract = {The specific growth rate constant for bacterial growth does not obey the Arrhenius-type kinetics displayed by simple chemical reactions. Instead, for bacteria, steep convex curves are observed on an Arrhenius plot at the low- and high-temperature ends of the biokinetic range, with a region towards the middle of the growth range loosely approximating linearity. This central region has been considered by microbiologists to be the "normal physiological range" for bacterial growth, a concept whose meaningfulness we now question. We employ a kinetic model incorporating thermodynamic terms for temperature-induced enzyme denaturation, central to which is a term to account for the large positive heat capacity change during unfolding of the proteins within the bacteria. It is now widely believed by biophysicists that denaturation of complex proteins and/or other macromolecules is due to hydrophobic hydration of non-polar compounds. Denaturation is seen as the process by which enthalpic and entropic forces becomes imbalanced both at high and at low temperatures resulting in conformational changes in the enzyme structure that expose hydrophobic amino acid groups to the surrounding water molecules. The "thermodynamic" rate model, incorporating the heat capacity change and its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the system, fitted 35 sets of data for psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria well, resulting in biologically meaningful estimates for the important thermodynamic parameters. As these results mirror those obtained by biophysicists for globular proteins, it appears that the same or a similar mechanism applies to bacteria as applies to proteins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

abstract = {The lag time of Listeria monocytogenes growing under suboptimal conditions (low nutrient concentrations, pH 6, and 6.5°C) was extended when the inoculum was severely stressed by starvation and the inoculum size was very small. Predictive microbiology should deal with bacterial stress and stochastic approaches to improve its value for the agro-food industry. In predictive microbiology, it is commonly assumed that inoculum size has no effect on subsequent microbial growth, and some studies (8, 9, 10) have confirmed this for growth of Listeria monocytogenes. However, Gay et al. (12) observed that inoculum size could have an effect on the duration of the lag phase of L. monocytogenes under particular conditions simulating soft cheese ripening. This observation could challenge the validity of predictive models because growth modelling is usually done with initial concentrations of bacteria higher than 10 3 CFU ml 1 , even though foods are usually contaminated with lower numbers of cells. It has been shown with other bacteria, like Bacillus (19), Achromobacter delmarvae, Micrococcus luteus (see reference 16 for review), and Salmonella (26), that the duration of the lag phase depends inversely on the size of the inoculum. This phenomenon was observed only under a restricted range of conditions, for example, in poor but not in rich media, with starved cells (16), or with heat-injured cells (26). The aim of this work was to study the effect of inoculum size on the lag phase of L. monocytogenes growing in a poor medium, i.e., broth, containing only 1 g of Bacto Peptone (Difco Laboratories , Detroit, Mich.) per liter plus 0.85{\%} sodium chloride (Pro-labo, Paris, France) (TS), under suboptimal conditions: pH 6 and 6.5°C and with cells stressed by starvation. L. monocytogenes Scott A maintained on tryptone-soya agar (Oxoid, Unipath, Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 4°C was subcultured onto tryptone-soya agar (Oxoid) plus 0.6{\%} yeast extract (AES, Combourg, France) (TSYE) at 37°C for 24 h, and five colonies were transferred into TSYE broth and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This culture was used to inoculate TSYE broth to prepare inocula at 30°C. The change in viable count of L. monocytogenes in TSYE broth at 30°C determined on nonselective TSYE agar and selective Palcam (Oxoid) agar is shown in Fig. 1. The percentage of injured cells was determined by differential counts on selective and nonse-lective media (24). Inocula were prepared at 30°C for 14, 160, and 840 h to obtain cells in late log phase, early stationary phase after a decrease in cell viability of 96.8{\%} viable cells and 35{\%} injured cells and late stationary phase with a loss of viability of 99.9{\%} and 21{\%} injured cells (Fig.},

abstract = {When presented with nutrient mixtures, several human gut Bacteroides species exhibit hierarchical utilization of glycans through a phenomenon that resembles catabolite repression. However, it is unclear how closely these observed physiological changes, often measured by altered transcription of glycan utilization genes, mirror actual glycan depletion. To understand the glycan prioritization strategies of two closely related human gut symbionts, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we performed a series of time course assays in which both species were individually grown in a medium with six different glycans that both species can degrade. Disappearance of the substrates and transcription of the corresponding polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) were measured. Each species utilized some glycans before others, but with different priorities per species, providing insight into species-specific hierarchical preferences. In general, the presence of highly prioritized glycans repressed transcription of genes involved in utilizing lower-priority nutrients. However, transcriptional sensitivity to some glycans varied relative to the residual concentration in the medium, with some PULs that target high-priority substrates remaining highly expressed even after their target glycan had been mostly depleted. Coculturing of these organisms in the same mixture showed that the hierarchical orders generally remained the same, promoting stable coexistence. Polymer length was found to be a contributing factor for glycan utilization, thereby affecting its place in the hierarchy. Our findings not only elucidate how B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron strategically access glycans to maintain coexistence but also support the prioritization of carbohydrate utilization based on carbohydrate structure, advancing our understanding of the relationships between diet and the gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE The microorganisms that reside in the human colon fulfill their energy requirements mainly from diet- and host-derived complex carbohydrates. Members of this ecosystem possess poorly understood strategies to prioritize and compete for these nutrients. Based on direct carbohydrate measurements and corresponding transcriptional analyses, our findings showed that individual bacterial species exhibit different preferences for the same set of glycans and that this prioritization is maintained in a competitive environment, which may promote stable coexistence. Such understanding of gut bacterial glycan utilization will be essential to eliciting predictable changes in the gut microbiota to improve health through the diet.},

abstract = {Whether the thermal sensitivity of an organism's traits follows the simple Boltzmann-Arrhenius model remains a contentious issue that centers around consideration of its operational temperature range and whether the sensitivity corresponds to one or a few underlying rate-limiting enzymes. Resolving this issue is crucial, because mechanistic models for temperature dependence of traits are required to predict the biological effects of climate change. Here, by combining theory with data on 1,085 thermal responses from a wide range of traits and organisms, we show that substantial variation in thermal sensitivity (activation energy) estimates can arise simply because of variation in the range of measured temperatures. Furthermore, when thermal responses deviate systematically from the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model, variation in measured temperature ranges across studies can bias estimated activation energy distributions toward higher mean, median, variance, and skewness. Remarkably, this bias alone can yield activation energies that encompass the range expected from biochemical reactions (from ∼0.2 to 1.2 eV), making it difficult to establish whether a single activation energy appropriately captures thermal sensitivity. We provide guidelines and a simple equation for partially correcting for such artifacts. Our results have important implications for understanding the mechanistic basis of thermal responses of biological traits and for accurately modeling effects of variation in thermal sensitivity on responses of individuals, populations, and ecological communities to changing climatic temperatures.},

abstract = {The ecology of microbes frequently involves the mixing of entire communities (community coalescence), for example, flooding events, host excretion, and soil tillage [1, 2], yet the consequences of this process for community structure and function are poorly understood [3–7]. Recent theory suggests that a community, due to coevolution between constituent species, may act as a partially cohesive unit [8–11], resulting in one community dominating after community coalescence. This dominant community is predicted to be the one that uses resources most efficiently when grown in isolation [11]. We experimentally tested these predictions using methanogenic communities, for which efficient resource use, quantified by methane production, requires coevolved cross-feeding interactions between species [12]. After propagation in laboratory-scale anaerobic digesters, community composition (determined from 16S rRNA sequencing) and methane production of mixtures of communities closely resembled that of the single most productive community grown in isolation. Analysis of each community's contribution toward the final mixture suggests that certain combinations of taxa within a community might be co-selected as a result of coevolved interactions. As a corollary of these findings, we also show that methane production increased with the number of inoculated communities. These findings are relevant to the understanding of the ecological dynamics of natural microbial communities, as well as demonstrating a simple method of predictably enhancing microbial community function in biotechnology, health, and agriculture [13]. Coalescence of whole communities occurs frequently in the microbial world. Here Sierocinski et al. study coalescence of methanogenic communities. Both methane production and composition of the mixed communities resemble that of their best individual component, suggesting modular co-selection of species. This effect increases when more communities are used.},

Here, a meta-analysis of 92 experimental studies shows that product formation responds twice as strongly to increased temperature than diffusion or transport. This response difference has multiple consequences for biochemical reactions, such as potential shifts in the factors limiting reactions as temperature increases and reaction-diffusion dynamics that predict potential product inhibition and limitation of the reaction by entropy production at temperatures below Tden. Maximizing entropy production by the reaction predicts Topt that depend on enzyme concentration and efficiency as well as reaction favorability, which are patterns not predicted by mechanisms of enzyme state change. However, these predictions are strongly supported by patterns in a meta-analysis of 121 enzyme kinetic studies. Consequently, reaction-diffusion thermodynamics and entropy production may constrain organism performance at higher temperatures, yielding temperature optima of life that may depend on reaction characteristics and environmental features rather than just enzyme state changes.},

abstract = {Background. Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes. Results. We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme. Conclusion. Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical network - manually or automatically - into a dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases. {\textcopyright} 2006 Liebermeister and Klipp; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A mathematical technique for integrating growth and thermal inactivation models of microorganisms into a smooth combined model that can be applied to circumstances under which the temperature gradually rises from growth to inactivation regions is described. For the death part of the model, a correction term is introduced to allow for additional resistance of the cells gained during slow heating. The model was validated with Brochothrix thermosphacta heated in broth at rising temperatures.},

@article{Freilich2011,
abstract = {Revealing the ecological principles that shape communities is a major challenge of the post-genomic era. To date, a systematic approach for describing inter-species interactions has been lacking. Here we independently predict the competitive and cooperative potential between 6,903 bacterial pairs derived from a collection of 118 species' metabolic models. We chart an intricate association between competition and cooperation indicating that the cooperative potential is maximized at moderate levels of resource overlap. Utilizing ecological data from 2,801 samples, we explore the associations between bacterial interactions and coexistence patterns. The high level of competition observed between species with mutual-exclusive distribution patterns supports the role of competition in community assembly. Cooperative interactions are typically unidirectional with no obvious benefit to the giver. However, within their natural communities, bacteria typically form close cooperative loops resulting in indirect benefit to all species involved. These findings are important for the future design of consortia optimized towards bioremediation and bio-production applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Phillips1987,
abstract = {The effect of temperature on the growth of psychrotrophs in dairy products has been studied using the 'square root' and Arrhenius models. The square root model has been shown to accurately predict temperature effects on the growth of several psychrotrophs in a number of dairy products. The formula can be applied for individual bacteria regardless of growth medium. This was not true for the Arrhenius equation. In this case, the apparent activation energy for growth ($\mu$) was dependent on source of isolate and growth medium. For isolates from pasteurized cream, $\mu$ values were lower during growth in double cream than those obtained during growth in full-fat milk. This was due to shorter generation times at lower temperatures when these isolates were grown in double cream. Temperature-growth parameters were similar for bacteria grown in pasteurized as well as UHT products. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

@article{Taillefumier2017,
abstract = {Metagenomics has revealed hundreds of species in almost all microbiota. In a few well-studied cases, microbial communities have been observed to coordinate their metabolic fluxes. In principle, microbes can divide tasks to reap the benefits of specialization, as in human economies. However, the benefits and stability of an economy of microbial specialists are far from obvious. Here, we physically model the population dynamics of microbes that compete for steadily supplied resources. Importantly, we explicitly model the metabolic fluxes yielding cellular biomass production under the constraint of a limited enzyme budget. We find that population dynamics generally leads to the coexistence of different metabolic types. We establish that these microbial consortia act as cartels, whereby population dynamics pins down resource concentrations at values for which no other strategy can invade. Finally, we propose that at steady supply, cartels of competing strategies automatically yield maximum biomass, thereby achieving a collective optimum.},
